# Mindfulness Meditation Agent

## Project Overview

The **Mindfulness Meditation Agent** is a Python-based tool that generates structured mindfulness meditation scripts using OpenAI's GPT-4. The meditation scripts are tailored based on user input and are validated using Pydantic models to ensure a consistent structure.


- **Structured Outputs**: Generates meditation scripts with a JSON structure, including session duration, focus area, and a list of phrases with pauses.
- **Pydantic Validation**: Ensures that the generated scripts adhere to a strict schema for easy integration into other applications.
- **Dynamic Script Generation**: Customizes each meditation session based on the user's input, such as the desired duration and focus area.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes tests to verify the functionality and robustness of the meditation script generation.

## Features

- Generates meditation scripts in a structured format.
- Adjusts durations and pauses from seconds to milliseconds.
- Validates the structure using Pydantic models.
- Unit tests to ensure script generation accuracy and reliability.

## Example Output

Here's an example of a structured meditation script generated by the agent:

```json
{
  "duration": 60000,
  "focus_area": "breath awareness",
  "phrases": [
    {
      "text": "Begin by finding a comfortable position.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Gently close your eyes and take a deep breath in.",
      "pause": 7000
    },
    {
      "text": "Feel the air filling your lungs.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Now, slowly exhale, releasing any tension.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Bring your attention to your natural breath rhythm.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Notice how your chest rises and falls.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "With each breath, feel more relaxed.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Inhale deeply, feeling calm and centered.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "Exhale slowly, letting go of any stress.",
      "pause": 5000
    },
    {
      "text": "When you're ready, gently open your eyes.",
      "pause": 3000
    },
    {
      "text": "Return to the present moment.",
      "pause": 5000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- An OpenAI account with access to the GPT-4 API.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shamimkhaled/mindfulness-meditation-agent.git
    cd mindfulness-meditation-agent
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

    Create a `.env` file using the provided template:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to include your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
    ```

## Usage

To generate a mindfulness meditation script, run the following code:

```python
from src.meditation_agent import generate_meditation_script

prompt = "Create a 60-second mindfulness meditation focused on relaxation."
meditation_script = generate_meditation_script(prompt)

if meditation_script:
    print(meditation_script.model_dump_json(indent=2))
else:
    print("Failed to generate meditation script.")
```
To run the streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Running Tests
To run unit tests, use the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests 

```
